## 🎉 Success Stories

### Track Improvement
"After using this for 2 months, I can see my average accuracy went from 78% to 85%, and my average blunders per game dropped from 2.3 to 1.1!"

### Identify Weaknesses
"I discovered I blunder way more in bullet than blitz. The data showed 3.5 blunders/game in bullet vs 1.2 in blitz. Now I focus more on blitz!"

### Opening Selection
"Found that my accuracy in the Sicilian Defense is 81% but only 72% in the French Defense. Time to focus on improving my French!"
